Syntax:
	error recovery

Semantics:
	test forward function declarations

General:
	refactor comp_lib
	parser.y cleanup and polishing

Done:
*	break is not error. it is statement. instead we must use contexts to check for constructs that use loops, so that we can assign value to break or continue statements
*	real constants : atof already converts between them
*	l_value++
*	return statement type checking
*	function calls
-	array sizes
*	refactor error reporting
*	substitute error.c functions for my_error
