Syntax:
    error recovery

Semantics:
    break is not error. it is statement. instead we must use contexts to check for constructs that use loops, so that we can assign value to break or continue statements.
    l_value++
    function calls
    array sizes
    return statements

General:
    refactor comp_lib
